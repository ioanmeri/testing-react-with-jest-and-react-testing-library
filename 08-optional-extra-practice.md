# Optional Extra Practice

## Standard Questions to Ask

- **What to render**?
  - what's the smallest component that encompasses tests?
- Do we need to pass any **props**?
- Do we need to wrap in, say, `OrderDetailsProvider`?
  - Does the provider get used? Is it already wrapped within the component?
- Where should the tests go?
  - which file? **New file** needed?
- What to test?
  - What's the **behavior** that needs testing?
- Do we need to `await`?
  - is there anything async going on?
